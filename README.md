react boilerplate
=====================

A *new* Webpack boilerplate with:

* hot reloading React components;
* [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/) over Facebook flux
* [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) as the router
* [normalizr](https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr) as JSON serializer
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as package manager

## Getting Started

```
yarn install
yarn run start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Then go ahead and edit files inside `src` (any file except `index.js`).
