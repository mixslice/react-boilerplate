// We use this Normalizr schemas to transform API responses from a nested form
// to a flat form where repos and users are placed in `entities`, and nested
// JSON objects are replaced with their IDs. This is very convenient for
// consumption by reducers, because we can easily build a normalized tree
// and keep it updated as we fetch more data.
